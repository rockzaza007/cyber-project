# Cybersecurity Project

## Description

This project is aimed at developing a cybersecurity application that implements various security features including CRUD operations, authentication, authorization, encryption, and Docker containerization.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on sensitive data.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
- **Authorization**: Enforce access control policies to determine user permissions.
- **Encryption**: Utilize encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Docker**: Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
